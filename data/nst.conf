#
# Common input modifiers are: SHIFT, CONTROL, LOCK (caps lock), MOD1 (Commonly Alt key), MOD2 (Num Lock), MOD4 (Commonly Windows Key), MOD5 (e.g. AltGR).
#
# You can also check the output of `xmodmap -pm` for your currently setup
# modifier keys.
#
# KeySyms are found in the "keysymdef.h" X11 header e.g. "XK_End" -> "End" for
# the End key. You can also use the X11 `xev` tool to learn the KeySym string
# for a specific key press.
#
# You can also provide the special value "[disable]" to turn of the shortcut
# completely.
